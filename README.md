### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are white, whitesmoke and dark grey. This color scheme fits well alongside my D25 logo.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Raleway font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Raleway really caught my eye and it pairs well with other commonly used fonts within programming.
    -   #### Imagery
        -    Imagery is important. The large, hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also calls out community to me and this want I wanted to bring to the home page.
